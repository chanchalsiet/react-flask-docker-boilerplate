# React + Flask Development Boilerplate

## Overview
Extremely lightweight development environment for a web application
running a [React](https://reactjs.org/) front-end and 
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) API back-end. The 
front-end connects to the back-end by making HTTP requests for
desired data. React and Flask are containerized.

### Why Create React App?
[Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) allows 
us to very easily *create a React app* with no build configuration. React is 
currently one of the most popular front-end Javascript libraries for 
building UIs.

### Why Flask?
Flask is a lightweight, highly-customizable micro-framework for Python. It let's
us build really simple web applications quickly ([the "hello world" app is literally 5 
lines of code](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)).
